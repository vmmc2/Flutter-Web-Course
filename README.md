## Problems when cloning a repo from GitHub and Android Studio complaining about the Dart SDK?
* The Dart SDK is under the flutter folder, more specific the path is usually the following: flutter\bin\cache\dart-sdk
* After setting the correct path described above, you should hit the button: "Get Depedencies" and everything should be ok.

## Hot Reload not working?
* Hot Reload is a tool provided by the Flutter Team which allows us to test the changes we made in our code almost simultaneously after we actually changed it.
* But Hot Reload will only work if we are dealing with Stateless or Stateful Widgets. Otherwise, it won't work properly.
