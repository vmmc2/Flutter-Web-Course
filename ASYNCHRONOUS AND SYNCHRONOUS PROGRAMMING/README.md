# Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming.

Info about async and sync programming.

## Note about the keywords "async" and "await:
* These two keywords are used just when we have a function that needs to get data (but this function) takes a long time and we there is another function after it that will use the previous function's data. So we must wait to get the data from the first function.
